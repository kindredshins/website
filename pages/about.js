        Kindred Shins are well known for creating myths, but it&apos;s a lesser
        known fact that&hellip;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They created the word gullible, which they later traded for a
          meringue.
        </li>
        <li>
          They shot the sheriff and the deputy, they are stone cold
          motherfuckers.
        </li>
        <li>
          They once beat Enrique Inglesias at poker and took his mole as
          payment.
        </li>
        <li>
          They once smelt what The Rock was cooking, and didn&apos;t like it,
          not one bit.
        </li>
        <li>
          They invented the flavour brown, later to be used in brown sauce.
        </li>
        <li>They started the first ever rumour.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        They are flamboyant, gun totting, smut peddling troubadours that were
        first flung together for the Winter Olympics of 1988 for the Jamaican
        bobsled team. They produced a blistering performance, setting a world
        record pace before their accident cruelly robbed them of their deserved
        medal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite their success and returning to their homeland as heroes the work
        quickly dried up. After a series of ill fated business ventures and the
        untimely death of John Candy they found themselves living on the mean
        streets of trench town.
      </p>
      <p>
        They quickly formed a skiffle band and played to the local trampista to
        hone their skills before taking their act to the local cabaret shows
        around town. Due to their acerbic charm and grotesquely pretty features
        they started to gain notoriety and also reclaim their riches and social
        standing.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first they succumbed to the pleasures of the flesh, ending their
        famine of decadence, they soon came to the conclusion that they were old
        too soon and smart too late. They decided to donate all the money they
        were making to Adin Drakmer and continued to live on the streets and
        make the music that you listen to today.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are renowned for being lethal on the dance floor and are
        historically a letdown in the bedroom but don&apos;t let that put you
        off trying to be the first one to coax a resounding performance out of
        them.
