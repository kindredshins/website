      Kindred Shins are flamboyant, gun totting, smut peddling troubadours
      who&apos;s ability to create myths are legendary. They were first flung
      together for the Winter Olympics of 1988 for the Jamaican bobsled team,
      they produced a blistering performance, setting a world record pace before
      their accident cruelly robbed them of their deserved medal.

    <p>
      Despite their success and returning to their homeland as heroes the work
      quickly dried up, after a series of ill fated business ventures and the
      untimely death of John Candy they found themselves living on the mean
      streets of trench town.
    </p>
    <p>
      They quickly formed a skiffle band and played to the local trampista to
      hone their skills before taking their act to the local cabaret shows
      around town, due to their acerbic charm and grotesquely pretty features
      they started to gain notoriety and also reclaim their riches and social
      standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first they succumbed to the pleasures of the flesh, ending their famine
      of decadence, they soon came to the conclusion that they were old too soon
      and smart too late. They decided to donate all the money they were making
      to Adin Drakmer and continued to live on the streets and make the music
      that you listen to today.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are renowned for being lethal on the dance floor and are historically
      a letdown in the bedroom but don&apos;t let that put you off trying to be
      the first one to coax a resounding performance out of them.
