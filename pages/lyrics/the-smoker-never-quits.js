    <h3>V1</h3>
    <p>
      Ease my need for your striptease, well I need you to need my need,
      <br />
      Make me think that it’s you that’s sated, your moneys made you don’t care
      how you make it
    </p>
    <h3>V2</h3>
    <p>
      Well I can’t leave till you’re my cochise, cos I need you to need my need,
      <br />
      My new look is so outdated, we’ll keep on speaking till the lust turns to
      hatred,
    </p>
    <h3>V3</h3>
    <p>
      Well I concede my greed for your striptease,
      <br />
      But I need you, to need my need,
      <br />
      My mind will give you more than a mention,
      <br />
      You keep me seated but you love the attention,
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      Oh you know I know, you’ll say anything that I need, till you go home,
      <br />
      You’re not the one that I’m searching for.
    </p>
