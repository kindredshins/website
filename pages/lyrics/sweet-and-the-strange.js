    <h3>V1</h3>
    <p>
      She said there’s nothing left, so please stop pleading on your knees,
      <br />
      But my broken heart won’t start, the wounds too deep to bleed,
      <br />
      The truth goes I’ve always known, that I’m not good enough to keep,
      <br />
      So don’t waste your time on loving me, don’t waste your time on loving me
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      But I’m pleading, I just don’t know what to say,
      <br />
      I guess it’s the sweet and the strange,
      <br />
      And I guess we’re one and the same,
      <br />
      And I’m pleading, I just don’t know what you mean, I just don’t know how
      to speak,
      <br />
      I just don’t want you to leave,
      <br />
      I just don’t want you to leave,
      <br />I just don’t want you to leave
    </p>
    <h3>V2</h3>
    <p>
      Can’t we pretend I’ll be, the little thing you wish I’d said,
      <br />
      And I’ll scheme and skive all day girl, if it leads to your bed,
      <br />
      The truth goes I’ve always shown, that I’m not good enough to keep,
      <br />
      So don’t waste your time on loving me, don’t waste your time on loving me
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      But I’m pleading, I just don’t know what to say,
      <br />
      I guess it’s the sweet and the strange,
      <br />
      And I guess we’re one and the same,
      <br />
      And I’m pleading, I just don’t know what you mean, I just don’t know how
      to speak,
      <br />
      I just don’t want you to leave,
      <br />
      I just don’t want you to leave,
      <br />I just don’t want you to leave
    </p>
    <h3>V3</h3>
    <p>
      She said there’s nothing left, so boy stop pleading on your knees,
      <br />
      But my broken heart won’t start, the wounds too deep to bleed,
      <br />
      And I loathe to let you go, but I’m not good enough to keep,
      <br />
      So don’t waste your time on loving me, don’t waste your time on loving me
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      But I’m pleading, I just don’t know what to say,
      <br />
      I guess it’s the sweet and the strange,
      <br />
      And I guess we’re one and the same,
      <br />
      And I’m pleading, I just don’t know what you mean, I just don’t know how
      to speak,
      <br />
      I just don’t want you to leave,
      <br />
      I just don’t want you to leave,
      <br />I just don’t want you to leave
    </p>
