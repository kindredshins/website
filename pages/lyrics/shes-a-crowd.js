    <h2>She&apos;s A Crowd</h2>
    <h3>V1</h3>
    <p>
      The merry go round, she’s gotta get out,
      <br />
      A town with no crowd, a scream with no sound,
      <br />
      She’s eager to leave, to speak so unique,
      <br />
      She’s instantly seeked, as her feet meet the street,
      <br />
      It’s all that she craved, no familiar face,
      <br />
      No need to behave, no nights are the same,
      <br />
      Perpetual myth, perennial Miss,
      <br />
      She’s the last girl dancing at a party
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      And she needs somebody to lead her home,
      <br />
      Be the keeper of a secret that no one knows,
      <br />
      Not for a night or week but to be alone,
      <br />
      She just needs someone to lean on
    </p>
    <h3>V2</h3>
    <p>
      Momma I’m fine, the cities my life,
      <br />
      It’s all so divine, well never you mind,
      <br />
      So chew me and spit, to the edge of the cliff,
      <br />
      It’s not such the gift, if it brings on your fits,
      <br />
      It’s anyone’s guess, what time she’ll undress,
      <br />
      She’s anyone’s mess, well whoever is left?
      <br />
      As night turns to day, the mirror will change,
      <br />
      She’s the last girl dancing at a party
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      And she needs somebody to lead her home,
      <br />
      Be the keeper of a secret that no one knows,
      <br />
      Not for a night or week but to be alone,
      <br />
      She just needs someone to lean on,
      <br />
      Her eyes lack smile, blood that’s on the spoon,
      <br />
      Her gaze leaves yours and darts around the room,
      <br />
      Cos she’s known so many but loved so few,
      <br />
      And she just needs only to lean on you
    </p>
