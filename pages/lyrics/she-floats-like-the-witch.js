    <h2>She Floats Like The Witch</h2>
    <h3>V1</h3>
    <p>
      Strayed into the mayhem with a hand that never wins,
      <br />
      A slave to all the cravings and the haven that it brings,
      <br />
      Slowly our behaviour turns to traitor then to sin,
      <br />
      And I saved it, saved it, saved it from giving in.
      <br />
      Disguise your lies as alibis and show them what you’ve learnt,
      <br />
      Lay them on a bed of lies and claim that they’re the first,
      <br />
      Plagiarise your kind goodbyes and no one will get hurt,
      <br />
      Well I hate it, hate it, hate it for what it’s worth?
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      Make me believe that I’m not acting like a fool,
      <br />
      And I don’t want to you but I do
    </p>
    <h3>V2</h3>
    <p>
      I may not meet your mater and she may not never know,
      <br />
      I’m not a secret or your saviour or a problem that you’ll solve,
      <br />
      We can’t let love and hatred know cos they’ll only get involved,
      <br />
      And I’ve waited, waited, waited though no one knows
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      Make me believe that I’m not acting like a fool,
      <br />
      And I don’t want to want you but I do
    </p>
    <h3>Middle eight</h3>
    <p>
      And the letter that I left on the cabinet read,
      <br />
      “Can’t show my face if I’m hanging my head”
      <br />
      So I’ll be swinging from the rafters of the roof instead,
      <br />
      Cos the weight of my mind is too much for my neck,
      <br />
      And if love means pain in its little own way,
      <br />
      From the very first glance to the very last shame,
      <br />
      Well instead I shoulda said what the content meant,
      <br />I guess it all ends in tears again
    </p>
    <h3>Outro</h3>
    <p>
      I can’t keep being the one who’s always waiting,
      <br />
      When I just want to be free
    </p>
