    <h3>V1</h3>
    <p>
      And I’ve tried to please, to placate,
      <br />
      But it seems like I’m lost in the maze,
      <br />
      And I’ve tried to speak, to obey,
      <br />
      But you’ve left open the door to the cage,
      <br />
      And I’ve lied for greed, so ashamed,
      <br />
      Can’t believe that I’m fanning the flames,
      <br />
      And I’ve tried to be what you say,
      <br />
      It makes no difference to me anyway
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      And still in I lean for a little kiss,
      <br />
      And still now I plead for a little bit,
      <br />
      I’m killed by the need of another rift,
      <br />
      And still in I lean for a little kiss
    </p>
