      <h3>V1</h3>
      <p>
        Please don’t, because I’m sold,
        <br />
        I know that I’m the culprit though but even so,
        <br />
        Please don’t, I’ve no control,
        <br />I know you’re only trouble but I want you so
      </p>
      <h3>Chorus</h3>
      <p>
        Only a mind so cruel thinks a girl like you,
        <br />
        Is not the question to ask but the answer to,
        <br />
        The little things I lack, well that’s nothing new,
        <br />
        I won’t leave you alone,
        <br />I won’t leave you alone he says
      </p>
      <h3>V2</h3>
      <p>
        Please don’t, because I’m sold,
        <br />
        I know that I’m the culprit though but even so,
        <br />
        Please don’t, I’m begging no,
        <br />I know I barely know you but I want you so
      </p>
      <h3>Chorus</h3>
      <p>
        Only a mind so cruel thinks a girl like you,
        <br />
        Is not the question to ask but the answer to,
        <br />
        The little things I lack, well that’s nothing new,
        <br />
        I can’t leave you alone, I won’t leave you alone,
        <br />
        You know that skin on skin solves everything,
        <br />
        Even Sunday’s gift that’s only Monday’s sin,
        <br />
        It will hurt so bad, I can’t wait to begin,
        <br />
        I can’t leave you alone,
        <br />I won’t leave you alone he says
      </p>
    </LyricsPage>
