    <h2>As Is Tradition</h2>
    <h3>V1</h3>
    <p>
      Just a little fixation, a deal lost I’ve made,
      <br />
      If I play your game, if I play your game,
      <br />
      Dehumanisation, but I’m scared I’m brave,
      <br />
      For you I’ll change, for you I’ll change,
      <br />
      I’m so quick to hesitate.
      <br />
      Sweet manifestation, just cast aside,
      <br />
      Who in I confide, my blushing pride,
      <br />
      Well it’s hardly worth a mention,
      <br />
      It’s own demise, for you I’ll try, for you I’ll try,
      <br />
      Well the truth is a little lie
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      And you can be the needle to my vein,
      <br />
      You can be the sin that I entertain,
      <br />
      And you can be the only thing I own
      <br />
      You can be the only thing that I know,
      <br />
      The only thing I know when I’m all alone,
    </p>
    <h3>V2</h3>
    <p>
      Such an easy declaration, they’re just words I say,
      <br />
      To pass the blame, and I feel no shame,
      <br />
      Such a crowded isolation, to soothe the strain,
      <br />
      Confused and dazed, confused and dazed,
      <br />
      So quick to hesitate
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      And you can be the needle to my vein,
      <br />
      You can be the sin that I entertain,
      <br />
      And you can be the only thing I own
      <br />
      You can be the only thing that I know,
      <br />
      The only thing I know when I’m all alone
    </p>
    <h3>Outro</h3>
    <p>
      And I can be the one that you wanna save,
      <br />
      And I can be the one that got away,
      <br />
      I only ever run from the memory,
      <br />I only ever sleep with the enemy
