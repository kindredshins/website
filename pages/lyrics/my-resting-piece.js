    <h3>V1</h3>
    <p>
      Sold, but I just need to get her alone,
      <br />
      And if you leave then I’ll leave,
      <br />
      No little words get stuck in my throat,
      <br />
      But I’m oversure you’re something I adore
    </p>
    <h3>V2</h3>
    <p>
      The little time we spend on the floor,
      <br />
      Cos I’m weak when you leave,
      <br />
      Are you the cancer or are you the cure?
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      Well make room for me, in your bed I plead,
      <br />
      The fee I own, to get you down on your knees,
      <br />
      Cos the hope I hold, to give you a home,
      <br />
      It’s all but gone with every time that you leave,
      <br />
      Such a lonely soul for one that’s not alone.
    </p>
    <h3>V3</h3>
    <p>
      I just need to leave here I know,
      <br />
      But if it bleeds, let it bleed,
      <br />
      Cos you know the love that I don’t
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      Well make room for me, in your bed I plead,
      <br />
      The fee I own, to get you down on your knees,
      <br />
      Cos the hope I hold, to give you a home,
      <br />
      It’s all but gone with every time that you leave,
      <br />
      Such a lonely soul for one that’s not alone.
