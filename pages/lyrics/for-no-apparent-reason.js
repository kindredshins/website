    <h3>V1</h3>
    <p>
      If no one says it then it isn’t true,
      <br />
      I think I only like the thought of you,
      <br />
      You know your love it only leaves a bruise,
      <br />
      I’m only lonely cos I wanted you,
      <br />
      I lay for hours cos it never ends,
      <br />
      To make some promises to break again,
      <br />
      I’ll write a message that I’ll never send,
      <br />
      Cos it’s easier just to pretend
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      Allow me the hidden pleasure of the pain that I claim as mine,
      <br />
      Well I’ll only think my reply, you can read between the lines,
      <br />
      If knowledge is king well then, such the fool am I,
      <br />
      And love is truth well then I guess,
      <br />
      It shows I’ve always been a liar
    </p>
