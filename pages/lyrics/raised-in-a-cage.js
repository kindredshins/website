    <h2>Raised In A Cages</h2>
    <h3>V1</h3>
    <p>
      Less is more, unless it’s yours,
      <br />
      The saboteur is then the cure,
      <br />
      End the ride, well I don’t mind,
      <br />
      The habit’s fine when the habit’s mine,
      <br />
      Penny thoughts are so full of sin,
      <br />
      All the walls are closing in,
      <br />
      These crown of thorns, you’ve laid in place,
      <br />
      The first to run is the one I chase
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      Are you my diastole,
      <br />
      Or another truth that I’m sold,
      <br />
      That I just can’t bear to know?
    </p>
    <h3>V2</h3>
    <p>
      Less is more, then I am yours,
      <br />
      Sweet relief into the war,
      <br />
      She’s guaranteed, lack of sleep
      <br />
      As I’m drenched in the debris,
      <br />
      She’s not discreet, well how could it be?
      <br />
      She’s what I want but cannot keep,
      <br />
      The poison knows that this running joke,
      <br />
      Just likes to taste the antidote
    </p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      Are you my diastole,
      <br />
      Or another truth that I’m sold,
      <br />
      That I just can’t bear to know?
    </p>
