      <h3>V1</h3>
      <p>
        Well she asked me what’s wrong with infatuation, <br />
        between fiends cos satisfaction,
        <br />
        Is all that she needs, she’ll beg and she’ll plead,
        <br />
        So I’ll lay her on me just occasionally and I’ll leave,
        <br />
        It’s easy, I’m eager to play the traitor,
        <br />
        So give me the best of your bad behaviour,
        <br />
        You’re out of my reach, not out of my taste,
        <br />A smiles not the only thing you’ll wipe off your face, when it’s
        done
      </p>
      <h3>Chorus</h3>
      <p>
        Well it’s ain’t my nature to call a truce,
        <br />
        Give you an offer that you can’t confuse,
        <br />
        It’s an itch so sick you don’t get to choose,
        <br />
        Easily lead straight to your bed,
        <br />
        All eyes from around the room,
        <br />
        But I’m the one that gets to come with you,
        <br />
        So I hope
      </p>
      <h3>V2</h3>
      <p>
        Well I’m safe on the stage, so I’ll see you later,
        <br />
        Glad that you came, I’ll repay the favour,
        <br />
        Pull you real close, paw at your clothes,
        <br />
        Cos you’re closer to the throne,
        <br />
        With the lower you go, don’t you know
      </p>
      <h3>Chorus</h3>
      <p>
        Well it’s ain’t my nature to call a truce,
        <br />
        Give you an offer that you must abuse,
        <br />
        It’s an itch so sick you don’t get to choose,
        <br />
        Easily lead straight to your bed,
        <br />
        All eyes from around the room,
        <br />
        But I’m the one that gets to come with you,
        <br />
        So I know
      </p>
